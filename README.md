# Search-Bot
Team members: Sergio, Justin W, Ryan , Emily, Luke, Uriel, Joseph, Kojo, Justin T

Our team proposes a search bot that searches for information about news or leaks for different sports, music, and movies and to send this requested search to a website to be viewed. This bot will be programmed in a way that is adaptable to uses outside of Twitter or sports, movies, and music for future developments.
